The documentation will cover both technical and user aspects, ensuring that anyone interacting with the contract or reviewing the code can understand its purpose, functionalities, and usage.

## GreenEnergyToken Contract Documentation

### 1. Overview

`GreenEnergyToken` is an ERC20 token designed to tokenize the energy assets from green energy producers. It includes additional functionalities to manage carbon footprints through interactions with approved IoT devices. The contract allows for minting, buying, compensating, and managing carbon emissions.

### 2. Contract Details

#### Inheritance

The `GreenEnergyToken` contract inherits from the `StandardERC20` contract which implements the standard ERC20 interface.

#### Constructor

```solidity
constructor() StandardERC20("Green Energy Token", "GET", 100 * 10**18) {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

- Initializes the token with a name, symbol, and total supply of 100 tokens (adjusted for 18 decimals).
- Sets the deployer as the contract owner.

### 3. State Variables

- `footprintGenerated`: A mapping to store the carbon footprint generated by each company.
- `approvedIot`: A mapping to store the approved IoT device addresses for each company.
- `owner`: The address of the contract owner.

### 4. Events

- `Buy(address indexed to, uint256 indexed footPrint, uint256 indexed amount)`: Emitted when tokens are bought.
- `Compensate(address indexed to, uint256 indexed footPrint, uint256 indexed amount)`: Emitted when tokens are compensated.

### 5. Modifiers

- `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to functions to the contract owner.
- `onlyIOT`: Restricts access to functions to the approved IoT device of a company.

### 6. Functions

#### Public Functions

- `mint(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner`
  - Mints new tokens and stores them in the contract.
  - Restricted to the contract owner.

- `buy() public payable`
  - Allows users to buy tokens by sending Ether.
  - Emits a `Buy` event.

- `compensate(uint256 amount) public`
  - Allows users to compensate (burn) tokens they own.
  - Updates the carbon footprint.
  - Emits a `Compensate` event.

- `getFootPrint(address company) public view returns (uint256)`
  - Returns the total footprint of a company.

- `getIOT(address company) public view returns (address)`
  - Returns the approved IoT device address for a company.

- `changeOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner returns (bool)`
  - Changes the ownership of the contract.
  - Restricted to the contract owner.

- `approveIOT(address company, address iotDevice) public onlyOwner`
  - Approves an IoT device for a company.
  - Restricted to the contract owner.

#### IoT-Restricted Functions

- `addFootprint(address company, uint256 footprint) public onlyIOT(company)`
  - Adds the footprint generated by a company.
  - Restricted to approved IoT devices.

### 7. Usage Guide

#### Deployment

Deploy the contract using a script or directly through an Ethereum client like Remix. Ensure you are the deployer to become the contract owner.

```javascript
const GreenEnergyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("GreenEnergyToken");
const token = await GreenEnergyToken.deploy();
await token.deployed();
console.log("Token deployed to:", token.address);
```

#### Minting Tokens

Only the owner can mint new tokens:

```javascript
await token.mint(ethers.utils.parseEther("50"));
```

#### Buying Tokens

Users can buy tokens by sending Ether to the contract:

```javascript
await token.connect(user).buy({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });
```

#### Compensating Tokens

Users can compensate (burn) their tokens:

```javascript
await token.connect(user).compensate(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));
```

#### Adding Carbon Footprint

Approved IoT devices can add carbon footprint data for a company:

```javascript
await token.approveIOT(companyAddress, iotDeviceAddress);
await token.connect(iotDevice).addFootprint(companyAddress, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));
```

#### Changing Ownership

The current owner can transfer ownership to a new address:

```javascript
await token.changeOwner(newOwnerAddress);
```

### 8. Example Interaction Script

Here's an example script to interact with the contract:

```javascript
async function main() {
    const [owner, user, iotDevice] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const GreenEnergyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("GreenEnergyToken");
    const token = await GreenEnergyToken.deploy();
    await token.deployed();

    console.log("Token deployed to:", token.address);

    // Mint tokens
    await token.mint(ethers.utils.parseEther("50"));

    // User buys tokens
    await token.connect(user).buy({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("10") });

    // Approve IoT device and add footprint
    await token.approveIOT(user.address, iotDevice.address);
    await token.connect(iotDevice).addFootprint(user.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));

    // User compensates tokens
    await token.connect(user).compensate(ethers.utils.parseEther("5"));

    // Check remaining balance and footprint
    const userBalance = await token.balanceOf(user.address);
    console.log("User balance:", ethers.utils.formatEther(userBalance));
    const userFootprint = await token.getFootPrint(user.address);
    console.log("User footprint:", ethers.utils.formatEther(userFootprint));
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```
